# Requirement Elicitation

## 1.1 Domain Context
The **Student Smart Printing Service (HCMUT_SSPS)** operates within the domain of university printing services at **Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT)**. This system is designed to streamline document printing for students in the university.

Users can upload documents, select from available printers, and configure printing options such as paper size, page count, and number of copies. The system ensures efficient printing while tracking usage through comprehensive logs that include student IDs, printer IDs, and timestamps for each print job.

The service includes a page balance management feature, providing each student with a default number of A4 pages each semester and allowing them to purchase additional pages through an integrated online payment system (e.g., BKPay). Administrators, known as the **Student Printing Service Officers (SPSOs)**, can manage printer settings, adjust page limits, and configure permitted file types.

Automated reports on printing activity are generated monthly and yearly, giving the SPSOs insights into usage trends. All users must authenticate through the **HCMUT_SSO** service to ensure secure access. The service is accessible via both web and mobile applications.
