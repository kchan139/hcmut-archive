The sequence diagram illustrates how the printing process works for a student. The student first authenticates via the HCMUT SSO service. Once authenticated, the student can upload documents and select from available printers. After configuring printing properties (e.g., paper size, single- or double-sided printing, number of copies), the system starts printing if the document is loaded; otherwise, an error is generated.
