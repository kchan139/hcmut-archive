This activity diagram represents the process where a student submits a print job using the Student Smart Printing Service. The actor involved is the student. The process starts when the student uploads a document, which the system validates. If the document is invalid, the system prompts the student to upload it again. Once validated, the system shows the available printers for the student to select from. The student configures print settings like the number of copies, paper size, and whether to print single- or double-sided. After confirming the settings, the system processes the print request. If the request is processed successfully, the print job is executed; otherwise, the system notifies the student of an error.
